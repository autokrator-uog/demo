# Demo
This repository contains submodules for each of the various in-use repositories and takes advantage of the Docker containers of each to provide a simple way to start the entire application.

## How to run
In order to run the full application, follow the following steps:

  1. Clone this repository with the `--recursive` flag to ensure that all submodules are also cloned.
  2. Run `./demo setup` - this may take some time if you're building from scratch.

Further management of the running application can be achieved through use of the `./demo` script - run `./demo` for an explanation of available commands.
